    "The Idea\n",
    "I started this competition by simply feeding the pre-extracted features into a multi-layer perceptron with one hidden layer and got surprisingly good results, but I still had all this image data that I wasn't using. My immediate thought then was to simply combine a convolutional neural network on the images with the pre-extracted features MLP and train the entire model end to end. Keras's functional API gives us a really easy way to do this. Below, I'll outline the process of getting this model working along, point out some nice resources to learning about convolutional nets, and do some visualization of what the neural network is actually doing. But before we do that, let's just get all the data loading out of the way.\n",

    "If you take a look at Rhyando Anggoro Adi's post on the forum containing a GIF of each training sample for each species, you'll notice that for a given species most of the leaves look very similar except that the leaf is rotated slightly or is slightly larger in scale. We'll try to emphasize this in our dataset by randomly performing a rotation or zoom transformation to each leaf image as the image is passed to the neural network. Below is the code for the data augmentation image generator along with a slight change to the source code to help us out later on.\n",
    "NOTE: the change to the source code is not the only way to get around the problem of matching the indices of our two inputs (images and pre-extracted features). You can also manually shuffle the indices, set the shuffle parameter for the ImageDataGenerator to False, and flow the generator from the manually shuffled images."

    "Great! So we've got our combined model working that incorporates both the raw binary images of the leaves and the pre-extracted features. But you might ask now, what is the neural network actually learning? One easy way to tell what the convolutional portion of the neural net is learning is through visualization of the hidden layers. First, we'll pick a few random leaves from our validation set and we'll pass each one through the neural network. As the leaf goes through, the convolutional neural net will apply many filters each looking for something in the image. Once the filter is applied we'll grab the new image of the leaf and the white portions of the image will tell us where the filter activated and the black will tell us where it didn't. If you take a look at our architecture for the neural net, you'll notice we created 8 filters for the first convolutional layer and 32 for the second one. Thus, for each leaf image we should get a set of 8 and another set of 32 new images.\n",

    "Conclusion\n",
    "For the first convolutional layer we can sort of tell that most of the filters are doing edge detection on the leaf. That actually makes a lot of sense since pretty much all of the species specific information of a leaf is stored in the shape of its edge. The second convolutional layer is also mainly edge detection along with some point and edge shape detection I noticed with some leaves that have particularly special shapes. This is actually pretty common with convnets. The first few layers will do really simple stuff like edge and shape detection, but the deeper you go the more abstract it gets. Since we don't really have enough data to go that deep most of our filters look pretty tame. Judging by our LB score though, I think we can assume what it's doing is fairly constructive."
